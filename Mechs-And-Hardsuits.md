# Mechs and Hardsuits
Mechs and hardsuits are treading into others space and have been for a while, furthermore, mechs are heavily gimped mechanically in terms of movement and clunkyness because they are too powerful on station.

I propose the following to fix the issues here
## Hardsuits
Hardsuits morph into a more exosuits with modular building system and bonuses to specific attributes of a suit (i.e hazardous environment protection, or tool use, or defence), soaking up the aspects of mechs that were useable on station.

### Combat hardsuits
Exosuits/hardsuits should have no fixed extra weapons like heavy cannons and lasers and stuff, nor should they be armoured for combat, leave that for vest slots or actual armour, choosing the hardsuit should be a choice between being armoured, or utility/environmental protections. Having a module to hold a larger weapon in some concealable way is acceptable.

Combat hard suits are an area I don't feel comfortable addressing yet, and i don't see feasible ways to scale them for an unarmed station crew on a breakable station, without ending back where mechs went with being slow and clunky to use.


## Mechs
Mechs are moved off station, and cannot get back onto the station level, instead they are used on lavaland, lavaland is power scaled to match mechs and the speed/clunkyness of mechs is overhauled to feel powerful and fast.


This incentivises robotics to build mechs for station crew to stop around lavaland battling building sized monsters with rocket launchers and heavy laser cannons.


Sub notes to address comments raised

1) ashlizards, yes they are now ten foot tall super lizards who can go toe to toe with a mech
2) fauna are also buffed up in a similar fashion

## Firewall
There needs to be an ironclad firewall between lavaland and the station for this power scaling to work, only items/minerals can flow between them, this means no more ashlizards/megafauna on station.

## Mechs on station
Mechs are built in a mechbay on the station and then orbital dropped, in case you were wondering how they get built/maintained.

There's an orbital platform on the ground that will move a mech back to the mechbay to be repaired/upgraded, but mechs cannot (enforced by code) operate on the station level, no exceptions (see firewall comment)

### RIGsuits by Fikou
Firstly I'd like to say that if you have names that sound good that aren't RIGsuits I'd like to hear them because apparently RIGs were renamed to hardsuits because of copyright.

This is more or less a port of Bay's RIGsuits.
* You need to build the RIG control module, RIG cores are energy sources that can convert cell charge to power a RIGsuit, you need to order them from cargo (right now cargo works as a limitation from the crew all being equipped in hardsuit gear, there probably is a better solution)
* You print parts like the rig shells, gauntlets, helmets, suits and boots, attach the core and parts to shell and do some construction like with mechs, the last step will be applying external armor packs, probably printable from departmental lathes. Let's say you have your almost finished shell, you grab an atmospherics suit external armor from engineering and apply it to finish the hardsuit, creating an atmos hardsuit
* Every external armor type will have their own different protection and part complexity levels, for example the atmospherics hardsuit could be not protective from cold temperatures while its powerful against extreme heat, Chief Engineer's hardsuit would be really powerful with protection from radiation, cold and heat, so its max complexity would lower since the hardsuit has to handle a lot more
* All suits are equippable with modules, which are similar to mech modules (without the gun ones), modules have different complexity levels, if the combined complexity of the modules on the hardsuits exceeds max complexity level the hardsuit seriously malfunctions, modules would vary with things like health scans, AI/pAI controllers that could move your hardsuit from the inside while you are incapable, modules to store (maybe recharge using the battery?) guns, jetpacks similar to the ones we have on current hardsuits, stuff like toolset modules, ripley clamps would be badass, visors like mesons, medhuds, welding/flash protection modules, if oranges approves maybe integrated storage module the size of a box or something
* RIGs are an item going on your backpack slot you need to deploy them and then go through the sealing process for them to activate, the rig extends gauntlets, boots, a suit and helmet (if i succeed the gauntlets and boots will go over your current ones so you wont have to strip them), only when active they will use cell power and have things usable, when the cell runs out they could either auto unseal and deactive or maybe have the suit turn off but with the suit still sealed and not being able to move. so you would need to free yourself out
* Our current roundstart hardsuits would probably be replaced with roundstart external armor packs that you can give to robotics to give you the cool armor, not sure about what to do with them, maybe do the same for all head of staff hardsuits except the chief engineer one since he is big hardsuit man, the hardsuits in the places where they were previously would probably be replaced by either EVA suits or some cool department themed EVA suits
* A var would be introduced for very good hardsuits that should exist in the game but we dont want them to be changed, like hardsuits we don't want parts removed from, hardsuits that are too good to be upgraded or are just stupid that disallows them to be modified
* The Wizard and ERT hardsuits would probably stay the same mostly with self charging power cells and no modifying
* Miner gamer loot hardsuits from tendrils would be removed likely
* Ninja suit would be refactored into the new system with some of the abilities turned into modules
* The various meme suits like carp or america would probably transfer to rigs without any major changes
#### Rambling/Problems:
* Getting modules, probably most will be just printable with a mineral usage that actually matters (powerful mech guns using like 5 sheets of metal lol), some available through a cargo crate, maybe some as rare maint loot?
* Oranges doesn't want hardsuits to be armored, im wondering if he means 0 across the board or something like the emergency firesuit armor which is minor but can help a tiny bit and is roundstart, and if i should make bio resistance 100 which every space suit has
* Not sure what to do with security and syndicate hardsuits and oranges doesn't either I think, maybe make security hardsuits have different modes they could switch to with a cooldown? mode that allows you to move faster, one to protect you from space and one mode for each type to protect against melee/bullets/lasers with a baton holster and gun storage modules in the armory, something similar with syndie suits.
* Storage problems on antag hardsuits, just give them not crew available backpack sized integrated storage modules?
