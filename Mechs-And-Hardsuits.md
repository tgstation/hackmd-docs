# Mechs and Hardsuits
Mechs and hardsuits are treading into others space and have been for a while, furthermore, mechs are heavily gimped mechanically in terms of movement and clunkyness because they are too powerful on station.

I propose the following to fix the issues here
## Hardsuits
Hardsuits morph into a more exosuits with modular building system and bonuses to specific attributes of a suit (i.e hazardous environment protection, or tool use, or defence), soaking up the aspects of mechs that were useable on station.

### Combat hardsuits
Exosuits/hardsuits should have no fixed extra weapons like heavy cannons and lasers and stuff, nor should they be armoured for combat, leave that for vest slots or actual armour, choosing the hardsuit should be a choice between being armoured, or utility/environmental protections. Having a module to hold a larger weapon in some concealable way is acceptable.

Combat hard suits are an area I don't feel comfortable addressing yet, and i don't see feasible ways to scale them for an unarmed station crew on a breakable station, without ending back where mechs went with being slow and clunky to use.


## Mechs
Mechs are moved off station, and cannot get back onto the station level, instead they are used on lavaland, lavaland is power scaled to match mechs and the speed/clunkyness of mechs is overhauled to feel powerful and fast.


This incentivises robotics to build mechs for station crew to stop around lavaland battling building sized monsters with rocket launchers and heavy laser cannons.


Sub notes to address comments raised

1) ashlizards, yes they are now ten foot tall super lizards who can go toe to toe with a mech
2) fauna are also buffed up in a similar fashion

## Firewall
There needs to be an ironclad firewall between lavaland and the station for this power scaling to work, only items/minerals can flow between them, this means no more ashlizards/megafauna on station.

## Mechs on station
Mechs are built in a mechbay on the station and then orbital dropped, in case you were wondering how they get built/maintained.

There's an orbital platform on the ground that will move a mech back to the mechbay to be repaired/upgraded, but mechs cannot (enforced by code) operate on the station level, no exceptions (see firewall comment)
