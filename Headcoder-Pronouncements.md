# Headcoder pronouncements
Here is a list of pronouncements that don't fit anywhere else.

#### Lavaland/offstation content
No more lavaland or offstation content that's new, reworks to existing content only.

#### Supermatter as primary engine on maps
Maps not using the SM as their power source will be denied (already standing policy, just writing it down)


#### Alternate job uniforms
Jobs do not need multiple alternate uniforms in their closets, If you want to add a alternate uniform, you can put it in a cargo crate, or put it in costume vendors that are public access.
##### Formal uniform
The only exception to this is Heads of Staff, who can have a single formal outfit as well (This includes QM)
