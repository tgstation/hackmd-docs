# Research and Development

So active points generation hasn't worked, techwebs is a total mess, points generation is massive one round, and nothing the next.


I want techwebs overhauled.

Flat rate point generation, from start of round and ticking upwards.

Sub chains of research should be gated by a scientific experiment, what that looks like for each part of the web is up to users implementation choice, it might be redeeming something like a slime, or building a specific nanite/virus, it should be related to the technologies in question

The techweb console should be moved to the bridge and added to Head of staff PDA's, so they can oversee research for their depts and techwebs is no longer seen as a "science" job.


The core research techs should be achievable in 60 minutes, with extension trees being possible but only a selection of them, I.e you have to choose some focuses.

I will not accept PR's that do not conform to this design.
